# Instructions for Cloudflare Tunnels on DOCKER with Nginx Proxy Manager(formerly known as Argo Tunnels)


# NOT COMPLETE - DO NOT USE

 
  
   
    
Argo Tunnel creates a secure, outbound-only connection between your services and Cloudflare by deploying a lightweight connector in your environment. With this model, your team does not need to go through the hassle of poking holes in your firewall or validating that traffic originated from Cloudflare IPs.

# Prerequisite

For this setup you need:
1. A domain which is managed by CloudFlare, and can be done on the free plan. 
2. Docker running on a server.
3. Nginx Proxy Manager setup and running.

# Set-Up Steps

1. In your temrinal, run the following command to authorise cloudflared with the cloudflare site you want to setup with a tunnel.

```
docker run -it --rm -v /cloudflared:/home/nonroot/.cloudflared/ cloudflare/cloudflared tunnel login 
```
It will print out a link to cloudflare. Put this link in your web browser, and select which domain you want to use. Then, the daemon will automatically pull the certificate.

2. Now we need to create a tunnel. To do this we will run another command from the unraid terminal<br>
\*\*\* Change TUNNELNAME to the name of the tunnel you wish to create \*\*\*

```
docker run -it --rm -v /cloudflared:/home/nonroot/.cloudflared/ cloudflare/cloudflared tunnel create TUNNELNAME
```




This will create your tunnels UUID.json file, which contains a secret used to authenticate your tunneled connection with cloudflare. The JSON file is only needed for running the tunnel, but any tunnel modifications require the cert.pem. More information about what requires what can be found [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/create-tunnel).

Make sure you copy your UUID, as this will be used in later steps. It can always be found later by the name of the JSON file.

3. Now we need to create a config.yaml to configure the tunnel

```
nano /cloudflared/cloudflared/config.yaml
```
4. Now paste in the following and amend your reverse proxy IP:PORT and tunnel UUID

```
tunnel: UUID
credentials-file: /cloudflared/.cloudflared/UUID.json

ingress:
  - service: https://REVERSEPROXYIP:PORT/
    originRequest:
      noTLSVerify: true
```
5. Now, we need to install the app inside the Unraid UI.

   - Go to the CA Apps Tab

   - Search for cloudflared

   - Install from aeleos' Repository

   - Make the following changes:
 
6. Now we need to change the "Post Arguments". To do this we need to enable the "Advanced View" in the top right corner.

   - You should see the below command inside of "Post Arguments". Replace UUID the the UUID for your tunnel generated in step 2.

```
Post arguments: 
tunnel run UUID
```

7. Now you can start your container and if all done correctly with no errors, you should have a running tunnel!

8. The next step will be to edit your domain DNS records.

If you have an A record already, you can remove this as it is now not needed.

Replace your A record with a CNAME record, that points to the domain root (@) and for the content, you need to add UUID.cfargotunnel.com (inserting your UUID that was copied earlier).
  
## Example
  
|Type|Name|Value|TTL|Status|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|CNAME|@|UUID.cfargotunnel.com|Automatic|Orange ☁️|
|CNAME|plex|@|Automatic|Orange ☁️|
|CNAME|portainer|@|Automatic|Orange ☁️|
|CNAME|radarr|@|Automatic|Orange ☁️|
|CNAME|sonarr|@|Automatic|Orange ☁️|
  
You should now be able to access all of your apps without needed a port forward!
